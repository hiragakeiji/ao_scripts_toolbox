# Conventions

## Folder structure
- 1 tool = 1 folder
- Must include:
  - `README.md`
  - main script file(s)
- Optional:
  - `assets/` for images (png/gif)

## Naming
- Tool folder: `ao_<tool_name>`
- Main script: same as folder name (e.g. `ao_xxx.py`)
- Keep names lowercase with underscores.

## README requirements per tool
Each tool README must include:
1. What / Why (1-2 lines)
2. Requirements (app/version)
3. Install / Setup
4. Usage (copy-paste runnable)
5. Notes / Known issues (if any)

## Compatibility
- If a tool is version-specific, write it in the tool README.
